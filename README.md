# RCB IPL SQL Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset with a focused case study on Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The analysis combines objective metrics and subjective insights to evaluate team performance, player impact, and strategic decision-making.

## Dataset
The analysis is performed on a structured IPL relational database containing match-level and ball-level data. Key tables include:
- matches
- ball_by_ball
- player
- team
- season
- venue
- wicket_taken
- player_match

## Objectives
- Analyze RCB’s historical performance across seasons
- Evaluate player contributions using key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Assess the impact of toss decisions, venue conditions, and home advantage
- Identify strategic gaps and provide recommendations before mega auctions

## Analysis Performed
### Objective Analysis
- Team win percentage and season-wise trends
- Home vs away performance
- Player batting and bowling statistics
- Venue-wise performance
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)

### Subjective Analysis
- Toss impact on match outcomes
- Home-ground advantage analysis
- Player versatility and all-round contributions
- Factors behind high-scoring matches
- Strategic recommendations for RCB
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL (Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations)
- Microsoft Excel (visualizations)
- PowerPoint (presentation)
- GitHub (version control)

## Key Insights
- RCB shows strong batting performance but inconsistent bowling across seasons
- Home-ground advantage plays a significant role in match outcomes
- All-rounders and bowling depth are critical for improving team balance
- Data-driven strategies can significantly improve auction and squad decisions

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL-driven analytics can be used to derive meaningful insights from sports data and support strategic decision-making in team sports like cricket.
